# Weather-App


## Description

Building this project was a long process, and definitely the hardest project we've had so far. I enjoyed learning so much more about APIs, localStorage and functions than I had known before. The process was an exercise in patience, and the result is a working weather app! I feel there are some areas where I feel could use a good polishing, but I am overall very happy with the finished product. 

My biggest challenge was overcoming a lack of API knowledge, which I am certainly happy to now have a better understanding of.
