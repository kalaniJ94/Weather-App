    <!-- header will be a simple one, needs only a "Weather Dashboard h1" -->
    <!-- On the left side we have a search form "Search for a city", which will have an input and a search button. Button will need an id for event listener, and the search field will need a id for the text grabber. -->
    <!-- Below that, the old search history will display. The aside and the container below will function identically to the challenge last week, it seems like. SEARCH RESULTS MUST BE A LINK, AND DISPLAY THE REPORT AGAIN -->
    <!-- Next to the search card, the rest of the space below header will be taken up by a display div, showing the City chosen, the date, an icon to indicate weather, and temp, wind, and humidity. -->
    <!-- Finally below that, Ill have a 5 day forecast (which should also be a h3). THis will be five cards displayed in a row, showing date, an icon for the weather, temp, wind and humidity. -->
